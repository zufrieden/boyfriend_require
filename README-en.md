Bio
---
It's been 7 years since I moved to Tokyo. I thought I could find someone
anytime I wanted, but before I knew it I turned 30. I work as a Software
Engineer, but am interested in management and business strategy as well.
On the weekends I often attend public events and seminars held in my
neighborhood, but for the most part I read, write down ideas I have based on
my experiences working in the industry, and play the piano. I'd like to find
someone who I can live leisurely with, allowing us both to enjoy our work and
personal lives.
